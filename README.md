- **Vue 2**: Frontend framework.
- **SASS**: For styling and animations.
- **Bootstrap**: For styles and UI components.
- **PHP**: Handles server-side logic for processing email submissions through the `email.php` file in the `api/` folder.

## 🗂️ Project Structure

- `api/`: Contains the backend logic for handling API requests.
- `dist/`: Folder generated after the build, ready for production deployment.
- `screenshots/`: Contains screenshots showcasing the user interface and functionalities of the portfolio.
- `public/`: Static files and the `index.html`.
- `src/`: Contains the main components, views, and project files.

## 📜 Scripts

The project has the following scripts defined in the `package.json`:

- `npm run serve`: Starts the development server.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production.
- `npm run lint`: Runs the linter to detect and fix code issues.
- `npm run format`: Formats the code using Prettier.

## 📋 Environment Variables

This project uses environment variables to manage configuration settings. You can find the following variables in the `.env.example` file:

```bash
VUE_APP_PORT=3000
VUE_APP_API_ENDPOINT_URL=http://localhost:8000
VUE_APP_CV_URL=
VUE_APP_GA_ID=
VUE_APP_RECAPTCHA_V3_SITE_KEY=
```

- `VUE_APP_PORT`: Set the port of development server (default: 3000).
- `VUE_APP_API_ENDPOINT_URL`: The API endpoint URL for making requests (default: `http://localhost:8000`).
- `VUE_APP_CV_URL`: The URL of CV.
- `VUE_APP_GA_ID`: The Google Analytics ID (not required).
- `VUE_APP_RECAPTCHA_V3_SITE_KEY`: The reCAPTCHA v3 site key (required if using the contact form).

Make sure to copy the .env.example file to .env and replace the values with your actual settings before running the project.

## 🐘 Running the PHP Server for sending emails (Only if you have PHP installed on your computer)

To start the PHP server for sending emails, ensure that PHP is installed on your machine and that the required environment variables are properly set. First, navigate to the `/api/` directory and install the necessary dependencies by running:

```bash
composer install
```

Before running the PHP server, ensure create a `.env` file from the `.env.example` file and set the required environment variables:

```bash
APP_NAME='XiaoDev Portfolio'
APP_ENV=local

CONTACT_MAIL_FROM=
CONTACT_MAIL_PASSWORD=
CONTACT_MAIL_AUTH=
CONTACT_MAIL_HOST=
CONTACT_MAIL_PORT=
CONTACT_MAIL_SECURE=
CONTACT_MAIL_TO=

RECAPTCHA_URL_VERIFY=https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api/siteverify
RECAPTCHA_V3_SECRET_KEY=

ACCESS_CONTROL_ALLOW_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000
```

- `APP_NAME`: The name of the application.
- `APP_ENV`: The environment of the application (local/production).
- `CONTACT_MAIL_FROM`: The email address from which the contact form submissions are sent.
- `CONTACT_MAIL_PASSWORD`: The password for the email address from which the contact form submissions are sent.
- `CONTACT_MAIL_AUTH`: The authentication method for the email server (true/false).
- `CONTACT_MAIL_HOST`: The host of the email server (e.g., smtp.gmail.com).
- `CONTACT_MAIL_PORT`: The port of the email server (e.g., 587).
- `CONTACT_MAIL_SECURE`: The security method for the email server (tls/ssl).
- `CONTACT_MAIL_TO`: The email address to which the contact form submissions are sent.
- `RECAPTCHA_URL_VERIFY`: It's the default Google URL used to validate reCAPTCHA responses (default: `https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api/siteverify`).
- `RECAPTCHA_V3_SECRET_KEY`: The secret key for reCAPTCHA v3 validation.
- `ACCESS_CONTROL_ALLOW_ORIGIN`: Specifies which origins are allowed to access the API (CORS) (default: `http://localhost:3000`)

Once the environment variables are set, you can start the PHP server by running:

```bash
php -S localhost:8000
```

## 🐳 Running the PHP Server for sending emails with Docker (Only if you don't have PHP installed on your computer)

If you don't have PHP installed on your computer, you can easily run the PHP server using Docker. The required Docker configuration is already set up. To start the server, follow these steps:

1. **Install Docker**:  
  If you haven't installed Docker yet, download and install it from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

2. **Run Docker Compose**:  
  Once Docker is installed, navigate to the `/api/` directory where the Docker configuration files are located and run the following command to start the PHP server:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```
    This will start the necessary containers, including PHP, and the server will be accessible at http://localhost:8000.

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:  
  Ensure that the .env file is properly configured with the required environment variables, as described above. The server running inside Docker will use these variables to handle email sending and reCAPTCHA validation.

4. **Access the PHP Server**:  
  After running docker-compose up, the PHP server should be running on http://localhost:8000.

## 🛠️ Build and Deployment

For building the project, run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

The generated files will be in the `dist` folder, ready to be deployed to any web server.

## ☁️ Uploading to a Web Server

To deploy the project to a web server, simply upload the contents of the `dist` and `api` folders to the server. Ensure that the server supports PHP and that the necessary environment variables are properly set.

> ⚠️ **Warning**: For `api` folder, only the following files are required:
> - `vendor/` (The folder containing the dependencies installed via Composer)
> - `logs/` (The folder for storing log files, if applicable)
> - `email.php` (The PHP script responsible for handling email submissions)
> - `.env.production` (Rename this file to `.env` on the server)
>
> There is no need to upload any other files from the project.
